/**
 * Provides a convenient Java interface to the Intel RealSense T265 V-SLAM camera. Only the subset
 * of the librealsense that is useful to robot tracking is exposed in this class.
 *
 * <p>We employ JNI to call librealsense. There <i>are</i> Java bindings for librealsense, but they
 * are not complete and do not support our use-case.
 *
 * <p>This class works entirely in 2d, even though the tracking camera supports giving us a third
 * dimension (Z).
 *
 * <p>The coordinate system is as follows: + X == Robot forwards + Y == Robot left (left is from the
 * perspective of a viewer standing behind the robot)
 *
 * <p>All distance units are inches. All time units are seconds.
